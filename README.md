# datamining_scikitlearn
Leftover files from a college data mining class I took. Executable files are written in Python and contain basic implementation of using different classifiers on sets of data. Reports include the efficacy of each method.

Datasets that were used are not included because of their size, but the written reports will be uploaded here for my own archiving. If nothing else, I hope this repository can be useful for some stumped student out there trying to use the scikit-learn library.
